# GCSE_ColourNumbers
This is just a simple bot that counts up to a number of your choice in 16 colours as well as asking simple questions like your name and how you are.

Made for a school IT project then spent a few more hours at home working on it and doing things. I'll be updating this from time to time as this is the first project I've actually done for a school project. I'll also have a few other projects on my Github page. Idea is, 1 project, 1 repo. How this was basically meant to work in the first place anyway.
